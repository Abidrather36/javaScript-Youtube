//beware using var because it has scope issues //
//because it becomes global variable while declaring and its function scoped//
//var can be hoisted means we use it before declaring and value will be undefined //

//let on the other hand is block scoped means cannot acces outside {} //
// let can also be hoisted  and moved on top  but it will show reference error//
